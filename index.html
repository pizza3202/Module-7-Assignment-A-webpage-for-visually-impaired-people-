            <div class="content-container">
                <p>Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can cause vision loss and blindness by damaging a nerve in the back of your eye called the optic nerve. This nerve sends information from your eyes to your brain. When the nerve is damaged, you can lose your vision. At first, people with glaucoma lose their peripheral, or side vision. But if the disease is not treated, vision loss may get worse. This can lead to total blindness over time.</p>

            <h1>How to Recognize Glaucoma</h1>
            <p>Glaucoma is often called the "silent thief of sight," because most types typically cause no pain and produce no symptoms until noticeable vision loss occurs. For this reason, glaucoma often progresses undetected until the optic nerve already has been irreversibly damaged, with varying degrees of permanent vision loss. Once lost, this damaged visual field cannot be recovered. That's why regular eye exams are important to detect glaucoma before significant vision loss occurs.</p>
